# Types of Dashboard

Insight has three different types of Dashboards:

* Home dashboard

The Home dashboard is the place to get an overview of all the equipment registered on Insight.

The Home dashboard provides a general view of the equipment but only shows and calculates data based on the equipment that the user has access to.
