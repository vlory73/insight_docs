# Types of Dashboard

Insight has three different types of Dashboards:

* Home dashboard
* Group dashboard
* Equipment dashboard

## Home dashboard

The Home dashboard is the place to get an overview of the equipment registered on Insight.

The Home dashboard provides a general view of the equipment but only shows and calculates data based on the equipment that the user has access to.
