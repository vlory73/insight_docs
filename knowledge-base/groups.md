# Groups

## What are Groups?

Groups are a great way to organize equipment. 

Equipment may need to be organized in groups, for example, due to geographic distribution or if they are used together in a project. Insight Groups help you to streamline the processes of monitoring equipment, fetching data and delegating access.

## Adding Groups



Under Settings / Equipment, press the ... button on the top-right corner and select "Add Group".

Groups can be given a type. Group types are merely indicative and used for display purposes only.
