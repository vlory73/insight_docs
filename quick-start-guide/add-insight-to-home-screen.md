# Add Insight to Home Screen

Insight is designed to take into account the multiple devices that we have at our disposal on a daily basis.   
Thus, Insight works great on phones, tablets and computers.

In order to greatly improve the experience on mobile devices \(phones and tablets\) and give Insight a near-native application look and feel,  we recommend adding it to the Home Screen of your mobile device.

You will benefit from quick access to your favourite Remote Monitoring tool and at the same time experience it on a full page with no navigation bars or browser buttons.
