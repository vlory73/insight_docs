# PC requirements

## Windows

Computers with Windows operating systems require a driver to be able to connect to the FX30. The driver must be installed before connecting the PC to the FX30's Micro USB port. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The FX30 driver is available for download at [www.deif.com](https://www.deif.com/software/fx30_driver_package).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is strongly recommended to disable the Sierra Wireless Mobile Broadband Network Adapter to avoid that the computer takes over the data session.
{% endhint %}

## macOS

Mac computers running macOS do not require any installation of drivers.

## Linux

Computers with a Linux-based OS do not require any installation of drivers.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is strongly recommended to uninstall the _modemmanager_ to avoid that the computer takes over the data session when connected to the FX30.
{% endhint %}
