# Add the AGC-4 controller

Upon pressing again on the button to **Add new device**, we are given different option by means of tabs.

![The different templates available for the Generator equipment type](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

| Tab | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Predefined devices** | Allows to create devices based on templates created by DEIF for the Equipment Type chosen earlier. |
| **My devices** | Allows to create devices based on templates created within the current account. |
| **New devices** | Allows to create devices based on empty or platform related templates. |

We will now click once on the **+** button on the AGC-4 DG box to add a new AGC-4 to the Equipment and then press **Save.**

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of devices allowed on a single gateway depends on the Service Level attached.
{% endhint %}

We can now see that an AGC-4 controller has been created and linked to the device.

We can now change its settings by clicking on the pencil \(edit\) button.

Let's name it and proceed down.  
We now can see more of the content of the new device.  
The next step is to give it the correct network setting.

As we have seen in FX30 Setup, we need to set the controller and the FX30 in the same network area.  
We will set up the controller with IP **192.168.20.210**. The remaining settings do not need changes but may be adjusted as desired.

{% hint style="info" %}
The AGC-4 template offers a selection of values and notifications suitable for the basic needs.   
Additional tags and notifications can be added within the gateway's limits.
{% endhint %}

Press **Save** to continue.
