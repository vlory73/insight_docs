Clicking on the Equipment leads us to its Dashboard.\
When landing on an empty dashboard, a pop-up is shown to allow immediate editing.

After saving the dashboard,  we'll need press the More (...) button on the top right corner and select **Edit Dashboard** to do future changes.

## Adding content to the dashboard

Adding content to the dashboard is very easy. \
Simply press the **Add new widget** button and choose from a variety of Widgets and Widget Packs.

### Add a Widget

![There is a great variety of widgets to choose from](<../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)

Each widget has its own requirements in terms of configuration.\
Please note that Home and Group dashboards may introduce additional parameters to each widget.

The **Add now** option creates a widget with its default configuration.\
The **Edit first** option will open the widget configuration page. \
Please note that most widgets will require some configuration.

**Add now** a Value widget to the dashboard

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Move things around

In dashboard editor mode, the widgets may be dragged and dropped freely around the dashboard.\
Most widgets also allow resizing.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting is instantaneous. There is no confirmation dialog.
{% endhint %}

### Add a Widget pack

Adding widgets to a dashboard is fun, but we made it easy to add multiple widgets in one simple action.\
Widget packs are sets of pre-configured widgets which can be added to a dashboard to provide almost instant value.

You can also create your own widget packs by selecting multiple widgets and selecting **Save to pack**.

![Choosing a pre-defined Widget pack for the dashboard](<../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Each dashboard type has its own listing of available Widget Packs.
{% endhint %}

After inserting a widget pack, the device must be selected on the widgets.\
If the tags defined in the pack are available for the particular device, then the tag is automatically inserted** **after the device is selected.

To finish and apply the changes, press the **Save** button. \
Alternatively, you can **Cancel** which will revert back to the last saved dashboard configuration.
